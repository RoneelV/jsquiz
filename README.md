## Current status

- Main quiz question answers need major boost, currently there are mere 5 demo questions
- Results currently only shows answer was correct, wrong or not attempted
- Not too semantic
- Not that good styling and positioning
- Leaderboard pending
- No testing

So, major refactor coming

### To see current dev-version (no build)

```sh
- git clone -b dev https://github.com/RoneelV/jsquiz.git jsquiz

- cd jsquiz

- yarn; yarn start (if you use yarn)

Or

- npm install; npm start (if you use npm)
```
